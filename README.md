# Linux Auto Install Nice Stuffs
My Linux auto-install linux software

### Why every single line has an install command?
To indent and comment well every package. Shellscript limitations to read code.  

You can easily download the scripts like this:  

```sh
$ wget bit.ly/debcore -O core.sh
$ wget bit.ly/debfunny -O fun.sh
$ sudo chmod +x core.sh fun.sh
$ ./core.sh
$ ./fun.sh
```
